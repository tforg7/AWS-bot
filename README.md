# Advisor bot using AWS

Since machine learning and NLP are disrupting finance to improve customer experience, I decided to create a robo advisor that could be used by customers or potential new customers to get investment portfolio recommendations for retirement. 

It combines new Amazon Web Services skills with other Python skills, to create a bot that will recommend an investment portfolio for a retirement plan.

The procedure is this one:
1. Amazon Lex bot with a single intent that establishes a conversation about the requirements to suggest an investment portfolio for retirement.
2. Make sure that the bot is working and responding accurately along with the conversation with the user, by building and testing it.
3. Create an Amazon Lambda function that validates the user's input and returns the investment portfolio recommendation. This task includes testing the Amazon Lambda function and making the integration with the bot.

This repository contains:
1. A short video of the result in Amazon Lex
2. The Code used for Lambda function
3. Export of the Amazon Lex settings.
